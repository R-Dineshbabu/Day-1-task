2.Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript
    
    * objects are datatypes in Javascript

    * objects are different than primitive datatypes

    * Primitive datatypes contain one value but objects can hold many values in form of key:value pair

    * These keys can be variables or functions and are called properties, every object has some prooerty 
    associated with some value

    * "A javascript object is a collection of name values having properties and methods"
       eg: person,car,pen,bike,personal computer.

      var car= {make:"mercendes",model:"C class",color:"white",fuel:"diesel",weight:"850kg",mileage:"8kmpl"} 

      console.log (car.color);

   output:
        white
