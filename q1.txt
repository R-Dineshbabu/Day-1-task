1.Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

 HTTP1.1:
       * In http1,1,if clients want to make multiple parallel request than multiple TCP connectiom must be
       used,in this behaviour only one response can be delivered at a time.

       * In http1.1 slow page reloads leads to
               # frustarated users
               # High bounce rates
               # Domain sharding
               # Image spirites

        * In http1.1 client wont understand htttp2 server and vice versa.

 HTTP2:
        * Http2 intoduce a new layaer called binary framing layer that is not in http1.1.

        * In binary framing layer HTTP2 removes the TCP limitation and enables full request and respond 
        at a time 

        * By allowing client and server to break down a HTTP message into independent frames,interleave
        them,and then reassemble on the other end.

        * only one TCP connection is enough for handle multiple frames of data.

        * HTTP2 compress http headers.

        * Allows server push.

        * Enables multiplexing
